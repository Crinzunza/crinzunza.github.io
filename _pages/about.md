I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Mathematical Modeling (**CMM**), Universidad de Chile. I am currently based at Universidad Católica de la Santísima Concepción, where I collaborate with the Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing Research Group (**GIANuC²**).

I obtained my **Ph.D. in Applied Sciences**, with a mention in *Mathematical Engineering*, at the **University of Concepción, Chile** (2020–2024). Previously, I earned my degree as a **Mathematical Civil Engineer** at the same institution (2011–2018).

**My work focuses on the numerical analysis of nonlinear and coupled partial differential equations (PDEs), especially using mixed finite element methods in Banach spaces.** I am particularly interested in **complex models arising in continuum mechanics**, such as **poroelasticity**, **heat transfer**, **stress-assisted diffusion**, and **chemotaxis–fluid interaction**. These problems often involve **multiphysics coupling** and lead to **nonclassical variational formulations** that require advanced analytical and numerical tools.
